    "Welcome to the second assignment for 50.055 Machine Learning Operations. These assignments give you a chance to practice the methods and tools you have learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment is an individual assignment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the instructions in this notebook carefully\n",
    "- Add your solution code and answers in the appropriate places. The questions are marked as **QUESTION:**, the places where you need to add your code and text answers are marked as **ADD YOUR SOLUTION HERE**\n",
    "- The completed notebook, including your added code and generated output and a labeled dataset which you create in the assignment will be your submission for the assignment.\n",
    "- The notebook should execute without errors from start to finish when you select \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells..\". Please test this before submission.\n",
    "- Use the SUTD Education Cluster to solve and test the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rubric for assessment** \n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be graded using the following criteria. \n",
    "1. Code executes: your code should execute without errors. The SUTD Education cluster should be used to ensure the same execution environment.\n",
    "2. Correctness: the code should produce the correct result or the text answer should state the factual correct answer.\n",
    "3. Style: your code should be written in a way that is clean and efficient. Your text answers should be relevant, concise and easy to understand.\n",
    "4. Partial marks will be awarded for partially correct solutions.\n",
    "5. There is a maximum of 150 points for this assignment.\n",
