When I spoke to my academic advisor she recommended not to do this though, since the workload for SUTD is already pretty tough. I think it also depends on which track you're in since certain mods may be required and they are only held during certain terms.

If you matriculated early, you would have the option to clear some mods before officially entering the school (only first year mods/HASS) so you could clear those credits beforehand. From what I heard from my friends graduating in 2025 they didn't have this option under early matriculation anymore though, probably need to check this.

2164,h4k8c68,"Hi, currently am phd student in sutd. To briefly answer your questions:

1) Research experience so far has been good. The school makes a lot of resources available and there are ample opportunities for collaboration.

2) Overall culture is friendly, though perhaps less close knit these days due to most people working from home. From the short time I spent in and around campus in my first year it was a very pleasant experience. The faculty members are generally really great as well, and are very approachable.

3) I believe all phds have to do at least 1 internship/research attachment, usually in the 3rd or 4th year. International internships might be hard to come by given covid though.

One thing I feel could be a very subjective matter is the size of the student body. Being from a very small pillar, we only have a few students every year and although this results in us being closer as colleagues and friends, it does result in resource pooling (i.e. sometimes courses are not available to us because there are only going to be 3 people taking the course if it were offered).

The idea that students apply to a major isn't universal, and neither is it universally agreed that applying to a uni to study one thing only is ""better"". SUTD (or its board, or whoever decides on the curriculum) believes that the base provided by the freshmore curriculum enables students to communicate similar concepts.

2769,gqbu2ff,"Like I said, if the pillar selection policy and procedure does not change, you will get whatever pillar you indicate.

I get where your concern is coming from, but I believe that is statistically unlikely. It is true that the ISTD population has boomed in recent years, while the ASD cohort appears to keep getting smaller, but I do not believe any pillar will be unable to attract even a single student anytime soon. Yes, there will be a strain in terms of resources for a more populous pillar. Yes, it might be that less-subscribed courses will be cancelled for a batch if there is insufficient interest (an example I can think of is one of the Term 7/8 ESD courses, which had less than ten people indicating their interest in it in an official survey). However, if a pillar already doesn't have that many students, I'm sure the admin people will be a bit more willing to have smaller class sizes. And I doubt SUTD would force students to go to another pillar if a pillar is seriously undersubscribed. I'm sure they'll find a way to deal with it unless they want to face some serious backlash.

And also, as I said in an older comment a longass time ago because I'm lazy to rewrite it:

>imo it is ridiculous to tell someone to go to another pillar that they may be even less interested in just because they have poorer grades and that pillar is less subscribed, and this may possibly signal ""hey this pillar is less worthy than this other pillar"" which is Not Cool

2171,h4f3aot,"Just graduated from the PhD programme a while back, here are my responses:

**Research Experience:** I really appreciated the interdisciplinary nature of SUTD which not only helped a lot in building one's academic portfolio but also gave a chance to interact with people from specialisations might not even typically talk to. This is especially so if your advisor's research team is comprised of researchers or other PhD students from various backgrounds, which helps in understanding how others think or do research. 

**Faculty**: Most faculty are very approachable and willing to help or collaborate with you, even if you are from a different pillar. I think this is bolstered by the fact that SUTD is still rather young and have hired a number of recent PhD graduates whom are open to trying out new things in their career. In fact, I feel that most profs are open-minded and are more willing to share the details of their own research, even in casual conversation. 

**Hurdles**: That said, most hurdles which I faced during my research would be dealing with certain admin departments. In general, getting approvals for *certain* matters might take more time than you would expect, in a university setting, which might hinder your research schedule. So it's best to factor that in if your research is 'less conventional' than the norm, especially when charting your research timeline.

**Internships**: Depends on your pillar. It's more mandatory for EPD track, but less so for ASD. I'm uncertain about ESD, ISTD or HASS though. 

As for international internships, I guess this is dependent on your contacts and subject to approval from the grad student office. Of course, the one greatest obstacle is overcoming Covid restrictions right now since Singapore (and even SUTD) is rather conservative in dealing with this.

2544,gttcu4t,"Stereotypically, if you get good grades and fifth rows records, it looks great to applying for programs in sutd, like an overseas program or taking minors.

But if you want to get a job, you must be wanted by the industry, meaning taking up projects that give an indicator that you have a particular set of skills.

But in hindsight, what do you really want? Would you mug all the way and get your first-class honors? Or have a decent grade and have a good life balance?

What is a priority? It is not really determined by the school. In fact, sutd allows you to make your own unique self, or portfolio.

Sutd kinda gives you quite a lot of opportunities. Officially, we got urops, honor programs, fifth-row projects, and whatnot, which is a low starting effort. Unofficially, you can kajiao prof or get from seniors/alumni if you make strong enough connections. Or rather, you will be pushed to make connections, and eventually, get what you want. Haha. In fact, that is what it is like when working outside in the industry.

So ya, maybe discover more, rather than being binded by the education system, as if it is a must-do to-do list curated by someone.

And ya, fifth rows can be competitive, but I don't think you need to be that competitive in order to secure an overseas program (more emphasis on grades)

And for portfolio, it is not whether you have won 1st prize or whatnot, but rather the skills you have in the end. Okay, maybe 1st prize will help HR filter through the first round, but I think what matter more is the interview in the next round",8/4/2021 14:41,POS,NEU

The only 3 criteria used are:

1. Disciplinary conduct. Ie: abiding by hostel rules.  
\- receiving a letter of warning/notice of breach is basically a surefire way to kill your chances
2. Participation in hostel activities  
\- to meet minimum participation count based on your period of stay; more terms = more events  
\- participating in more than required does not improve your standing (non-competitive nature)
3. Distance from campus based on time taken to travel from registered home address by public transportation

Might have some tweaks by the time you matriculate (who knows), but the system aims to provide housing for those who need it most, not encourage competition. Unfortunately, due to limited beds, it's impossible to provide a room for everyone :(

On the note of being a House Guardian to secure housing, you still have to satisfy the requirements as any other student would. On top of that, you will be assessed based on how well you have served your role as a House Guardian before your contract is renewed (yes, it is contractual. Because subsidies, PDPA and more :P).

Guides given to students are probably still the old ones.

Quick tips tho. 

1. Bookmark itservicedesk.sutd.edu.sg
There's promotions, quick links, essential programs to downloads, etc

2. Can't reset / unlock your account? Server not operating? Probably using the old site that is still up for some reason. Use the EASE portal for that.

3. Outlook not working?
The webmail should probably still work. Log into Ease and you should still be able to use.

4. Account lock out? Use your phone to unlock your account via EASE
There is a button under ""Login"" that says ""Need help signing in"" 
U can reset / unlock there.

5. New phone who dis.

Welcome to SUTD 

1. I have no experience with the ML module, hence I could only speak for the DB module. There are 5 hours of contact hours per week. 2 * 1.5 hr lectures / 2 hr cohort class (lab and tutorial).
2. There are homework, group projects, class participation and the final exam.
3. a) software design principles that are typically taught during first two years, abstraction, composition, encapsulation, and etc. b) understanding of multi-threading and concurrency, scheduling and deadlock c) OS basics, processes, file I/O, memory management d) Java Programming (or C#, or Python).
4. Normally 1 week or 2 before the term starts, i.e. mid Jan?

If it's of any consolation, I missed a 15% quiz for a pillar mod once, and scored terribly in the other quiz and both exams (I don't remember if we got our results back, but I do know I had no idea what I was doing at all; I just couldn't grasp the main parts).

However, the syllabus in SUTD taught me to not memorise memorise memorise like what everyone says bio is all about. I found bio to be challenging but fun, and for things I did not understand I'll consult friends that studied bio in JC.

Courses are mostly well structured with one concept taught each week, with the following week's concepts building on past weeks. Ask as many questions as you can during lessons, be it directly related to the topic currently being taught or otherwise.

2. From what I know all pillars are built on from the freshmore subjects, so no background is required. But being an engineering school, having a background in STEM is ideal.

It was a 1.5-hours test in an LT (or was it an hour long?), and if I'm not wrong it was basically a mix of GP Paper 1 and GP AQ, if you're familiar with the 'A' Levels. For those who aren't, basically it's an essay for us to discuss a given topic. (Though, I can't remember if a strictly argumentative essay was expected. But I don't think it makes a big difference in answering your question about what the EWET is.) There's no right or wrong answer, they just want to see how you argue and your command of English. I don't know of anyone who failed it, and I don't think you will fail unless your English is really atrocious. (That's what my OGLs told me at least.)

As my budget is somewhat limited, I don't think I can afford another tablet like iPad for handwritten notes. But a drawing tablet does sound like a good idea, so I will look into that.

Sufficient if possible.

Can't speak for AMD gpus though I read about it because I have never used it, Intel equivalent would be at least a 1060 (Idk if those still exist so 16 series). Yes, you can cad on a MX350 for single part files. You can even cad on integrated graphics if you choose to. Opening multiple files for reference or a multi part assembly in solidworks though... Definitely struggles a little. Do cad on your own computer, or a group mate's if you are looking at entry level graphics.

My main concern with you going for a MX350 though is your interest in AI applications. Understand most people nowadays recommend using cloud gpus (Google colab or smth), not really into it so can't advise. Simple models can definitely be done on entry level graphics, but running out of vram on deep learning models while training is a possibility, not to mention training time. Tried some stuff for research and interest. My laptop didn't make the cut, can't imagine what a mx350 experience will be like. I really do not know the scope of what is taught regarding AI.
